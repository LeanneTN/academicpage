👨🏻‍💻 I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Manchester.

🔬 I'm researching on combining artificial intelligence with biology and drug design, especially currently powerful Large Language Models.

🎓 I received my BEng degree at the Central South University, where I majored in software engineering in June 2024.

📜 See my [CV](https://leannetn.github.io/academicpage/cv) for detailed information about my academic background. See the [Publications](https://leannetn.github.io/academicpage/publications) for detailed information of my authored or co-authored papers and download them.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Research Projects Envolved

### CCF - Tencent Rhino-Bird Funded Project: LLM-based Intelligent Code Generating Technology

<img src='../images/RhinoBrid.png' align='right' style=' width:300px'/>
Funded by China Computer Federation (CCF) and Tencent AI Lab Rhino-Bird Project. This research proect aims to integrate current large language models into intelligent code generation tasks and push the technology towards application. To date, this project has yielded two publications and one more paper in review.

### National Level Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project

<img src='../images/neuralcat.jpg' align='right' style=' width:300px'/>
Funded by Education Ministry of China, and I'm  the co-founder and co-leader of this project. Kuramoto model-based Modelling and Application of Brain Structure and Functional Network. Aiming to build up the functional network (FC network) with a structural network (SC network) as the method to get an SC network is much easier than a FC network. This project is a joint application with Tianjin Normal University and Shanghai University of Financial and Economics. This project has closed with excellent project award and a feasible FC network prediction application.

## 👨‍🔬 Research Experience

### Research Assistant at School of Computer Science and Engineering, CSU
Supervised by Prof.Li Kuang, researching on
- nature language models in the area of code completion;
- graph neural networks and its application in the urban traffic flow prediction;
- large language models and its application in the intelligent software construction.
